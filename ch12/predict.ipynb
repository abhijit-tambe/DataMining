Remember that business with my car dealership this winter?  Well, consider this the epilogue.  The friendly fellas at the Valvoline Instant Oil Change on Snelling were nice enough to notice that my dipstick was broken, and the metal piece was too far down in its little dipstick tube to pull out.  Looks like I'm going to need a magnet.   Damn you, Kline Nissan, daaaaaaammmnnn yooouuuu....   Today I let my boss know that I've submitted my Corps application.  The news has been greeted by everyone in the company with a level of enthusiasm that really floors me.     The back deck has finally been cleared off by the construction company working on the place.  This company, for anyone who's interested, consists mainly of one guy who spends his days cursing at his crew of Spanish-speaking laborers.  Construction of my deck began around the time Nixon was getting out of office.\n",
